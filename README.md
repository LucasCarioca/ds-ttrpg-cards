## TTRPG Card Generator

This is a fork, original app by [charlespwd](https://github.com/charlespwd/dnd-magic-item-card).

This app's purpose is to create cards for various objects that can be used in your TTRPG game by both yourself, the DM, and your players.

The goal is to have easily printable MTG-sized cards you can stick to your draft chaff for:
- Items
- NPCs
- Locations

etc.
